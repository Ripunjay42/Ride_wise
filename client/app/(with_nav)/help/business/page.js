These fees pay driver-partners for the time and effort they spend getting to your location. Drivers are also able to cancel a ride request if they’ve waited a certain amount of time at the pickup location. You may be charged a cancellation fee, in this case, to reimburse your driver for their time. Note: We periodically experiment with changes to the cancellation policy. As a result, cancellation fees may be waived for a small subset of randomly selected cancellations." },
